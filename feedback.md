## Code Quality: Excelling
Good Semantic coding, properly named variables. Clean and easy to understand. 

* I would keep functions you aren't using in production in a different branch. 
* you don't need the excessive dashes and // 

## Technical requirements: Excelling
Awesome work using the API for your data. It is unfortunate that the API didn't give you the right sized flags, but it still came out amazing!
It was good that you had a backup plan from your original map idea hitting APIs is just the beginning for achieving that old idea you'll be able to do it in no time! 
I saw your duplicates issue, I've left a comment in your js file. Hope it helps! 

## Creativity and Interface: Performing
It's easy to navigate 
* would love to see this in a mobile version!

## Presentation: Excelling 
Nice README, I would've mentioned about how you can take on multiple users!

## Additional Feedback
There's some feedback in your js file!
Design feedback: In your modal, you have two submit buttons. Not the best UX, maybe just one form, one submit and if one of the input was left blank then a default quantity.
